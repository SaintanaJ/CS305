Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Through out this course we worked with the company known as Artemis Financial, the company was a Financial Firm that wanted us to set up a secure way for the company to go about it's business due to the sheer amount
of confidental and private information that was going through it on a day by day basis. However they also wanted us to make it easy to work with that anyone would be able to securely and safely.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I would say my strength in the projects lied within identifying the various vulnerabilities and what methods could be taken in preventing them and patching them out with the assistance of the various 
tools we where provided with within the projects.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The challenging part I would say was when new vulnerabilities would present themselves whenever fixes where applied, however this also proved helpful in identifying the domino effect of what can cause more vulnerabilities, errors and problems in the long run for software security development.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
For increasing the various layers of security, research was needed and the variety of methods that could be applied to making sure more layers of security where available. In this case the various encryption
methods that we had researched and worked with throughout our lessons.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Sadly for this part I simply didn't have the time to properly test the code once it was finished due to the deadlines. However what I would have done to make sure that the new vulnerabilities that would be introduced
would be ran through the vulnerability checker and to ensure they simply weren't false positives to save time and to ensure proper vulnerabilities would be thoroughly dealt with.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Dependency Checker proved to be a very very helpful tool throughout the whole project as each time I would work on the code I would run the checker to check for futher vulnerabilities or errors in the system.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Youtube, Books and Various Learning Tools as well as forum articles proved to be helpful in the long run for the assignments we where given.
